I did a inline 6 to v8 engine swap. The original speedometer is a cable drive and the tachometer has a normal input for a 6 cylinder. 
I tried to use a fancy black box to reuse the original Tachometer but that didn't work. The new transmission emits a signal from a 
Vehicle Speed Sensor. The Tachometer and Transiomission both emit a digital square wave signal. What to do?

Use an Arduino and make your own digital Tachometer and Speedometer. Simple, apart from the testing.
I will use the signal from the HEI Tachometer, the signal from the VSS on the Tremec T56 'wide ratio' and add a Hall Effect sensor on the rear axle.
I can use the signals from the Tach and the VSS to tell me what gear I am in. The MPH is a simple calculation from there. 
The hard part is getting the signal frequency from the VSS. The Tach frequency is 4:1.   

The lovely simple part of this project is the output. I am a huge fan of feefback, so I'm going all in. 
I called this project AllOut because I'm going to generate as much output as physically possible on the Arduino UNO R4 WiFi. 
This will include the on board 12x8 LED matrix, a 16x2 LCD, a 128x64 OLED and the Serial Monitor of the Arduino IDE. 
In the very near future, I'll add an SD card module for data logging. For now, the matrix displays the gear and rpm.
The LCD displays:
   top line = "RPM 6000 1 12000"  Engine RPM / Gear / Driveshaft RPM
bottom line = "A3567 MPH 254.79"  Axle RPM / MPH
The OLED displays the calculations. 
The Serial Monitor logs the function execution trace.
The SD card will record everything I can think of. 

ChatGtp is the bomb. From ChatGtp I got this: 
**Speedometer**
The Tremec T56 transmission typically uses a **Vehicle Speed Sensor (VSS)** that produces a **digital square wave signal**.
This signal is generated by a Hall-effect sensor, which detects the rotation of a reluctor wheel inside the transmission.
Key details about the T56 VSS signal:  
1. **Signal Type**: Digital square wave.  
2. **Output Voltage**: Often 5V or 12V, depending on the configuration and the vehicle's electronics.  
3. **Pulse Per Revolution (PPR)**: The number of pulses per driveshaft revolution can vary depending on the specific T56 model and application.
 Common setups **include 8, 12, or 16 PPR**.
If you're integrating a T56 transmission into a custom project or aftermarket setup, 
verify the VSS specifications for your specific application and ensure compatibility with your speedometer, ECU, or other devices using this signal.

**Tachometer**
The tachometer signal from a **Chevrolet High Energy Ignition (HEI) distributor** is a pulsed square wave generated by the ignition module.
Here are the key details:
### Signal Characteristics:
1. **Signal Type**: Pulsed square wave.
2. **Voltage**: Typically ranges from 0V to 12V, depending on the vehicle's electrical system. 
3. **Frequency**: The frequency of the pulses corresponds to the engine's RPM. For an 8-cylinder engine, 
there are **4 pulses per crankshaft revolution** (since the distributor fires once every two revolutions of the crankshaft).
### Tachometer Connection:
- The tachometer connects to the **TACH terminal** on the HEI distributor's cap. This terminal provides the output signal for the tachometer.
- Ensure the tachometer is compatible with the number of cylinders in the engine (e.g., 8-cylinder) and the voltage level of the HEI's output.
### Notes:
- If using an aftermarket tachometer, you may need a tachometer adapter or signal conditioner to match the signal output to the tachometer's requirements.
- NOTE I tried that and it didn't work.
- Verify proper grounding and secure connections to avoid erratic or inaccurate readings.

**Part One: Simulation**
The first version of the sketch is a simulation. It's fun. I learned how the Arduino does math and now to display that output to my liking.
**the Future**
incorporate an Sd Card
test the Tachometer signal
test the Transmission signal
test the Axle signal
put it all together into a 4" round guage
